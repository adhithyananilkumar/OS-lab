CPU Scheduling Demo

This repository demonstrates CPU Scheduling Algorithms as part of an Operating Systems assignment.
We are implementing the following algorithms step by step through GitHub collaboration:

First Come First Serve (FCFS) â€“ Implemented in C.
Shortest Job First (SJF) â€“ To be implemented next.
Round Robin (RR) â€“ To be implemented last.
ðŸ“Œ Algorithms Implemented
âœ… FCFS (First Come First Serve)
Non-preemptive scheduling algorithm.
Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue.
Easy to implement but may cause the convoy effect.
Inputs: Process ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time.
Outputs: Completion Time, Turnaround Time, Waiting Time, Gantt Chart.

ðŸ”„ GitHub Collaboration Workflow
Student A â€“ Created this repository and added Student B as a collaborator.
Student B â€“ Will implement Shortest Job First (SJF) and push.
Student A â€“ Will implement First Come First Serve (FCFS) and push.
Student B â€“ Will implement Round Robin (RR) and push.
Both students will merge all contributions and prepare final documentation.
