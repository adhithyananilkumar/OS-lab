CPU Scheduling Demo

This repository demonstrates CPU Scheduling Algorithms as part of an Operating Systems assignment.
We are implementing the following algorithms step by step through GitHub collaboration:

First Come First Serve (FCFS) â€“ Implemented in C.

Shortest Job First (SJF) â€“ Implemented in C.

Round Robin (RR) â€“ To be implemented last.

ðŸ“Œ Algorithms Implemented

âœ… FCFS (First Come First Serve)

Non-preemptive scheduling algorithm.

Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue.

Easy to implement but may cause the convoy effect.

Inputs: Process ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time.

Outputs: Completion Time, Turnaround Time, Waiting Time, Gantt Chart.
